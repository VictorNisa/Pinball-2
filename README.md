### About

This game was inspired by 01smile's pinball, which you can play [using this link](https://www.classicgame.com/game/Pinball+2), although some small details were changed. Most of the original game's mobile controls were removed in order to add debug functionalities like the mouse joint. Aditional game modes were also removed.

#### About the creators

This tribute game was made by [Victor Nisa](https://github.com/VictorNisa) and [Marc San Jos√©](https://github.com/marcsjm19).
